===============

Create a bootable iso to enroll custom secure boot keys.

This is a work in progress attempt to create an iso similar to the one used by [qemu-ovmf-secureboot](https://github.com/puiterwijk/qemu-ovmf-secureboot).
At present it will just use the efitools autogenerated keys, but the goal was to be able to specify your own keys to enroll.
